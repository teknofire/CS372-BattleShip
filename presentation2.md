# Pair Programming wins

Dylan: "Having someone watching over my shoulder was a big help to catching a lot of bugs and typos early on."

Will: "I find pair programming to be a fun way to work on projects, it definately helps to be able to quickly bounce ideas with someone else."

# TDD

Dylan: "I found breaking things down to have a Test for them and then making the code to make the Test work a valuable tool in making code work."

Will: "The thought process that goes into figuring out how to write a test is a really powerful step in the design process.  Especially when it comes to deal with UI or interface designs.  While it's hard to test the UI the methods it uses to interact with the system can be tested."
