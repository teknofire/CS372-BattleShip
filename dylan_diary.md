### 1 hour (class time)
Worked with will on fixing player and working on fleet.

### Overcourse of project Multiple Hours
Issue after issue arrises with getting my code to run. Hindsight states I have given up on my computer and gone down to the lab to work but I was being rather stubburn and wanted to get my computer working properly.
